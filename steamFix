When a steam game does not recognize the controller (in this case, Shadow Of Mordor), BUT the OS + Steam recognize it...

- make sure the controller is setup within steam. It doesn't matter how, as long as it is enabled and button presses/etc are recognized.
- make sure the controller is enabled for the game (by default, it should be)
- In the specific case of "fancy" controllers (in this case the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller), copy the .plist file to <Game Folder APP>/Content/Resources/InputDevices (you will likely have to "show package contents" to get there)
- disconnect the controller (ie: turn it off).
- start the game
- connect the controller

Steam *could* fix their abandoned software, but hey, that's just a little too expensive for a billion dollar company I suppose.
